# hi, i'm tecc

I'm a Swedish hobbyist software developer that likes to work on whatever.

I spend most of my time programming, with frequent breaks when I can't figure it out.

Some of my favourite games include Minecraft and Control (and by extension any game in the RCU).

## tools

For programming, I mainly use JetBrains Toolbox (e.g. IntelliJ, CLion, Rider), however in some cases, such as JavaScript/TypeScript (and occasionally C++), I'll use Visual Studio Code.

## more

There's not much more I can put in this readme.

I'll have more frequent updates over on [my website](https://tecc.me).
